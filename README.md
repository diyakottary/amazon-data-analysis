# Amazon-Sales-Analysis

In this project, I conducted a detailed analysis of Amazon's sales data using an interactive dashboard in Tableau. The analysis provided valuable insights into key sales metrics, trends, and performance indicators. The dashboard highlighted the following:

Key Insights:
**Items Distribution**: Cosmetics and Clothes lead with 13% each, followed by Office Supplies at 12%.
**Profit by Item Type**: Cosmetics generated the highest profit at $14.56M, with significant contributions from Household items ($7.41M) and Office Supplies ($5.93M).
**Order Priority**: High-priority orders, which make up 30% of total orders, yielded the highest profit at $16.89M.
**Sales Channels**: Sales were evenly split between offline and online channels, with offline sales contributing $24.92M to profit and online sales $19.25M.
**Geographical Revenue**: North America led with $39.67M, followed by Europe ($33.37M) and Asia ($21.35M).

This project has been instrumental in optimizing sales strategies, improving inventory management, and prioritizing orders to maximize profitability across different regions and sales channels. The insights derived from this dashboard are critical for driving data-driven decisions in the e-commerce domain.
